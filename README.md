# Flying Keys

Simple Python program using `PyGame` and `keyboard` modules to visualize keystrokes on the screen.

## Already implemented

- showing keystrokes
- flying keystrokes
- removing _dead_ (out of screen) keystrokes

## Wishlist

- collisions
- more fancy collisions - particle? explosions? :)
- collisions with objects on the screen (!).. how cool would that be..
- mouse events, not only keyboard
